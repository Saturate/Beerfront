Beerfront 
=========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Saturate/Beerfront.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Saturate/Beerfront)

The Open Source frontend for our new and upcoming app.

## Getting started
You will need to have [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) installed. You'll also need `bower` and `gulp`.

## Fiddler
You can setup fidler, so that you have live data on your gulp preview.
This is done like this `regex:http://localhost:9000/tables/{.*}` and map it to `http://beerevent.azurewebsites.net/tables/$1`.
